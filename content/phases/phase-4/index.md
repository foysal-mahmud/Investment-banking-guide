# Phase 4: Structured Products

**Structured products** are pre-packaged investments that combine derivatives with traditional assets to create customized risk-return profiles. They are the core business of investment banking product divisions.

German banks are among the world's largest issuers of structured products, with thousands of new products issued daily.

## What are Structured Products?

A structured product is:
- A **packaged investment** combining multiple components
- Issued by a **bank** (issuer risk applies)
- Designed to achieve specific **payoff profiles**
- Often linked to an **underlying** (stock, index, basket)
- Has defined **term** and **conditions**

### Why Do Banks Issue Structured Products?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fee income** | Structuring and distribution fees |
| **Customer demand** | Tailored risk-return profiles |
| **Hedging synergies** | Offset risks against trading book |
| **Competitive advantage** | Proprietary product design |

### Why Do Investors Buy Them?

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Capital protection** | Limit downside risk |
| **Enhanced yield** | Higher returns than deposits |
| **Market access** | Exposure to otherwise inaccessible assets |
| **Defined outcomes** | Known payoffs under specific conditions |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will understand:
- Capital protection mechanisms
- Yield enhancement products (discount, reverse convertibles)
- Participation products (bonus certificates)
- Autocallable structures (the most important!)
- How banks construct these products from option building blocks

## Topics Covered

1. **Capital Protection Notes** - Principal guaranteed products
2. **Discount Certificates** - Buy at a discount, capped upside
3. **Bonus Certificates** - Bonus if barrier not breached
4. **Reverse Convertibles** - High coupon, risk of stock delivery
5. **Autocallables** - Early redemption if trigger hit (VERY IMPORTANT)

## Structured Product Categories

### SSPA Classification (Swiss Standard)

| Category | Characteristics |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Capital Protection** | Principal protected at maturity |
| **Yield Enhancement** | Higher yield for accepting risk |
| **Participation** | Direct participation in underlying |
| **Leverage** | Amplified returns (covered in Phase 3) |

## The Building Blocks

Every structured product can be decomposed into simpler components:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Zero-coupon bond** | Capital protection |
| **Call option** | Upside participation |
| **Put option** | Downside protection or delivery risk |
| **Barrier option** | Conditional payoffs |
| **Digital option** | Binary outcomes (coupon triggers) |

> **📘 Example:** Capital Protected Note = Zero-coupon bond + Call option
> - Bond: Guarantees €100 at maturity
> - Call: Provides upside if underlying rises

## German Market Context

### Major Issuers

German and Swiss banks dominate European structured product issuance:
- Deutsche Bank
- Commerzbank
- DZ Bank
- BNP Paribas (German operations)
- Société Générale
- Vontobel
- UBS
- Credit Suisse (now UBS)

### Trading Venues

| Exchange | Specialty |
|----------|-----------|
| Börse Stuttgart (EUWAX) | Retail structured products |
| Börse Frankfurt | Blue-chip structured products |
| Gettex (Munich) | Commission-free trading |
| SIX Swiss Exchange | Swiss products |

### Product Volume

- **New issuances**: Thousands per day
- **Listed products**: Over 2 million on German exchanges
- **Turnover**: Billions of euros monthly

## Key Concept: Issuer Risk

> **⚠️ Warning:** Structured products are **unsecured debt** of the issuing bank.

Unlike exchange-traded options (cleared by a clearinghouse), structured products expose you to the credit risk of the issuer.

> **📘 Example:** Lehman Brothers 2008
> - Thousands of structured products became worthless when Lehman filed for bankruptcy
> - Investors lost capital even when underlyings performed well
> - Lesson: The bank's creditworthiness matters!

### Mitigating Issuer Risk

- Check issuer **credit ratings**
- Diversify across **multiple issuers**
- Consider **collateralized products** (rare)
- Understand **bail-in** regulations
