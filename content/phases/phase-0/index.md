# Phase 0: Financial Market Foundations

This foundational phase introduces you to the basic structure of financial markets. Before diving into complex products, you need to understand the ecosystem: who participates, what they trade, and where trading happens.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will understand:
- The fundamental purpose of financial markets
- The difference between primary and secondary markets
- Key market participants and their roles
- How investment banking differs from commercial banking

## Topics Covered

1. **What is a Financial Market**
2. **Primary vs Secondary Market**
3. **Market Participants & Roles**
